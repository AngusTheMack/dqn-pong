# Reinforcement Learning - Deep-Q Network
* Implementing Deep Q-Learning agent to play Pong.
* Refer to the following in order to understand the implementation:
  * [Human Level Control through Deep RL](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning)
  * [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
## Submission
* Implement model from research paper
* Understand hyperparameter optimisation
* Summary of Process (half a page)
* Plot of reward per episode (as in papers)
* Gif of agent playing pong
